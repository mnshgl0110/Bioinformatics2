task3,
a)
For S6, we can see a clear change of expression in t-CS-s to t-CS-m, making the drugged expression level more similar to normal c-CS-s.
For S6, the drug changed expression strongly in normal mice.
For P38, we can say that the drug has no effect on either phenotype. Though, there are other proteins in which we dont say any significant 
change in expression values cause of protein, but all of them shows similar expression for normal and trisomic mice and the similarity cannot be trusted completely.

b)
Raptor and p38
S6 and Tau

c)
maximum distance consistency is for Ubiquitin_N and Tau_N = 0.12

d)
I will select S6 and tau to make the decision. These two proteins have positively correlated expression data for 't-CS-m' class whereas for the normal mice saline "c-CS-s" class,
there is no visible correlation between the two.
I have plotted a scatter plot between the two proteins, the correlated one would let me know that the mouse class is "t-CS-m" while the uncorrelated would mean class "c-CS-s".

task4,
a) components needed to explain >95% variance = 8
b) 	no effect	: 0,1,2,4
	effect		: pca mode 4 (index 3)
d) individual mice clusters contains mouse ID : 361, 322
e) Number of components required increases to 20

task5,
f)
disconnected nodes: 3417, 363, 3484. Except 3484, they are not correlated.
c-CS-m seems to be strongly connected. No, there is no class for which I see no or very few connections between nodes in it.
